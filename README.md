Linear Regression

We will begin this assignment by deriving linear regression from minimizing error in y = mx+b for 1D functions. Then, we introduce the linear regression problem via OLS and showing students how to get a closed form solution through the orthogonal projection perspective. Students will be using matplotlib to visualize the data and their results throughout the assignment. They will then implement the analytical solution for simple and multiple linear regression problems. 

After that, students will be introduced to Scikit Learnâ€™s Linear Regression implementation for modelling and doing prediction. We also cover categorizing data and one-hot encoding as an application of linera regression. We will then provide a tougher regression problem that is nonlinear and introduce featurization as a way to do nonlinear regression. Students will featurize their data and perform linear regression to get high accuracy on this tougher regression problem. 

Finally, we will show students that linear regression can be used for not only regression tasks, but also classification tasks. We will have the students use linear regression to classify the Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica) Penguin Data and running regression on it to visualize decision boundaries. To this end, we will also guide students toward understanding the downsides of OLS and motivate/hint towards regularization.
